        Write a program which finds out the given number is FizzBuzz number or Fizz Number or Buzz Number

        For example your program should check numbers between 1 - 20
        Within given range above your program should check each number and:
        if the number divides by 3 and 5 without remainder it is FizzBuzz number
        if the number divides by 3 without remainder it is Fizz number
        if the number divides by 5 without remainder it is Buzz number

        Your output should look like this within 1 - 20 range:
        0 is FizzBuzz number
        3 is Fizz number
        5 is Buzz number
        6 is Fizz number
        9 is Fizz number
        10 is Buzz number
        12 is Fizz number
        15 is FizzBuzz number
        18 is Fizz number
        20 is Buzz number
