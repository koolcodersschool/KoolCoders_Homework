         Write a code When you run your code based on what option you choose it should print language and greeting in that language.
         Options are the following:
        String language = "";
        String greeting = "";
        int option  = 1;
        1 -> language is "English" and greeting is "Hello!""
        2 -> language is "Spanish" and greeting is "Hola!"
        3 -> language is "French" and greeting is "Bonjour!"
        4 -> language is "Azeri" and greeting is "Salam!"
        5 -> language is "Russian" and greeting is "Privet!"
        6 -> language is "Turkish" and greeting is "Merhaba!"
        Any other:
           -> We don't have that option. Please try 1 to 6. Thank you.

         For example if you assign 4 to option variable it should print. "Azeri ---> Salam"
                     if you assign 1 to option variable it should print. "English ---> Hello"
